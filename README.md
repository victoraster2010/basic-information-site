    Make a project directory and create the following files inside that directory:
        index.html
        about.html
        contact-me.html
        404.html
    Create your node.js server file index.js and add the code needed to serve the right page according to the url.
        localhost:8080 should take users to index.html
        localhost:8080/about should take users to about.html
        localhost:8080/contact-me should take users to contact-me.html
        404.html should display any time the user tries to go to a page not listed above.
